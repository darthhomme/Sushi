I'm building a CRUD application for a POS system that a restaurant server can utilize in filling orders.

I've drawn a crude wireframe as well as a basic ERD.

My storyline is that a server will greet the party and seat them. He or she will take their orders.

Server/admin will serve as the administrator, so they don't have a relationship to the patrons of the restaurant and to the staff.
